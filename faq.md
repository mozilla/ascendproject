For Participants
----------------

What are the supports for participants in the project?

	All participants will be provided with a stipend, daily breakfast & lunch, 
	transit passes, childcare support, and a laptop (which graduates keep)

How much is the stipend?

	$50 for each day of attendance

Is the stipend taxable income?

	Participants will have to submit a W-9 so SSN is involved but Mozilla
	is not responsible for taking taxes, individuals will have to claim 
	the income in their returns

How is the stipend administered?

	Weekly or bi-weekly - this is still in the planning stage, will update
	the site when confirmed

What's a typical day like? 

	Curriculum is under development but the overall plan is to have each 
	day contain a mix of technical work with cultural lessons and small 
	goals accomplished, each day is about working on the larger goal of 
	getting to committed code in production

	Classes are Monday to Friday, 9am - 5pm
	There will also be some evening mixers as well as offsite trips to 
	local orgs and companies 

How many classes can I miss?

	Ideally none but if you have concerns about absences please 
	make sure to discuss this during the applicant interview process

What if I decide the program isn't for me, or extenuating circumstances pop up? Do I still get to keep my stipend? Can I reapply another time? 

	The stipend is provided based on participation, so 
	missed days == no stipend for that day -- special arrangements can 
	be made by exception
	
	If someone decides they cannot complete the program we will make sure
	they receive the stipend for the days they did participate

	Should there be another Ascend Project in Portland re-application is
	welcome as we understand that circumstances change.  Motivation isn't 
	always enough, so please do try again if you are able to

Do I have to be LGBTQ to qualify? 

	Absolutely not - there are multiple intersections of applicability;
	race/class/sexual orientation among them, this project is for 
	motivated people, problem-solvers, who have felt pushed away,
	restricted by circumstances, or unsure how to get more deeply 
	involved in open source technical contribution

Does Mozilla provide childcare? What if I cannot get child care for certain days of class? 

	We will be working with wevillage (http://www.wevillage.com) for
	childcare assistance, if that isn't viable for a particulare case we
	can reimburse (to a per-participant limit) receipts from 
	registered childcare providers

	During the application process, if you require childcare assistance, 
	please be sure to bring it up so that the correct plans can be made
	for your childcare needs

What access and privileges do I have to the Mozilla facilities? 

	Access to all public space within the office, internet, plentiful snacks,
	photocopier/fax/scanner, Mozilla Project meetings, social events

How do I put the experience on my resume? 

	Participants who complete should have bug numbers & code commit history 
	(both recognizable within tech industry) as proof of their contributions, 
	effort, and knowledge

	We can also provide a certificate of completion to 
	state completion of 6 weeks of open source contribution training

	Letters of reference can be provided by request

	All participants will also have blog posts detailing their journey 
	which can show potential employers their process while building skills

	There will be open badges for certain aspects of the curriculum 

If I do well, will Mozilla hire me? 

	We absolutely cannot make this guarantee

	However we are working with the Gnome Outreach Project for Women 
	to allocate spaces for Ascend graduates so that continued, paid, 
	internships within open source are available (these often include
	Mozilla opportunities)

	Ascend is also working to create partnerships with local Portland tech 
	companies and seeking intern/contract/entry level opportunities to 
	send graduates towards

I really want to do this, but ... (circumstance). How can Mozilla help me?

	As this is a pilot we are collecting as much info in the application 
	process as possible so as to either address during these Betas if possible, 
	but also to add for consideration in future courses

	Please tell us what you need to be successful  

	Even if it's not a guarantee this time, you will be helping shape 
	how this project can better serve you and others going forward




For Administrators
------------------

Is this program college/university accredited?

	No

What accreditation do students receive?

	None

Total hours spent in 6 week course?

	240

What type of college course and level is this akin to? 200 level? Graduate level?

	This is a blend of a elements of a 300 level undergrad course, with 
	opportunities to up-level learning rapidly, and other opportunities 
	to connect with other non-traditional elements

Are students graded? What are the assessments? 

	There are no grades as the point of this course is to create 
	opportunity and each participant should be motivated to get the 
	most out of it, for their own elevation in tech once completed

	We will have milestones and goals to meet that will demonstrate 
	this motivation; blogging, badges, and committed code.
