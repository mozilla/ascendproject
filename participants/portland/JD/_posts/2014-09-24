Bug 725051 – Can’t copy or drag bookmark folders to or from Safari

This bug means a lot to me since Safari is now my default browser. 
I have also noticed I can’t dry my bookmarks either when I’m working with Firefox. 
I know how to import them manually but I can understand how this wouldn’t be an easy task for the average user. 
I would love to improve this feature and help make things easier for people who casually use computers.
