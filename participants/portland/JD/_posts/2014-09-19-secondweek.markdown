So this is my second week being apart of the Ascend Project at Mozilla.
And I have learned way more than expected. I am now a GIT FREAKING MASTAH!.
I have learned how to use four different versions of Firefox. I've tested the browser and some games
developed by Mozzila and have submitted my first bugs for them. I seriously am so greatful for this expirience.
It has made me more interested in this field of work, and I'm actually excited to start a career in this world.
Everyone that is apart of the project have beeen great help as well. I didn't expect to make so many new friends
in here. I can't wait to update you on the third week. Also here are the results from a test I ran through mozmill.
