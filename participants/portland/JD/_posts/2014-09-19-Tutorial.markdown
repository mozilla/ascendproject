So I'm going to show you how to use a Git Repository.
So open up the Terminal and use this command to go to wherever your Git Repo is located 
1.My command for example would be "cd ~/Sites/ascendproject"
2.You then would type the command "Git Status" to see if you're up to date with the origin branch.
3.If you aren't up to date you would pull from the repo so my command would be "git pull ascend"
4. Once you are up to date with the origin branch and you'd like to add your own changes
to the origin branch you would use the command "git commit" to save the changes.
5.Then you would "git push ascend" so the file gets sent to the original branch.
6. Then use "git status" to make sure all of the changes are correct and were sent to origin to be reviewed by the admins of the branch.

That is my tutorial on how to use a Git repository.
