My first week in the Ascend Project has ran very smoothly. Our mentors are very helpful, and have taught me a lot of information.
I didn't think I'd learn this much in one week. Doing git pull requests feels natural to me now.
All of the participants are from many different backgrounds. And I enjoy learning with every one of them.
I feel like we're part of some nerdy misfit hacker cult. Which is freaking amazing! 
I can't wait to share what I've learned in the second week. 
Below is a link to a project I made in popcorn maker. Check it out!
