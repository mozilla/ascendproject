#Third Week Middle of Light

#*Bug That I like 1026796
[Bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1026796)

I picked this bug because it had a recent date of 2014 not 2008. The bug is listed as a good first bug. I have used SDK's and I like one's that work correctly. 

I went following links to find out more about what was wanted. I found that this bug has priority 2, p2 need. I looked on the graph and found that it only pointed to bug 888483. Bug 888483 has a lot of open bugs. These bugs are part of Jetpack Project. The Jetpack Project has weekly meeting on vidyo and ab irc channel #jetpack. 

This looks like a good bug to start with current with lots of people available.
