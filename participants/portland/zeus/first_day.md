First day at Ascend Project
============

Well, as the weekend unfolds, I can't get to feel comfortable in the chair, or the bed, or the couch. The feeling of starting a long awaited dream has been a pretty deep desire of mine. Ascend, is that dream I asked for. It is even better than I imagined it in my head. It is perfect. The energy is surprising and the place amazing. Yet, still the feeling of nervousness wrapped my core in fountains of dry questions. 

As the the morning comes to a glare, the sun shines in the deep end of the east. I can feel my heart pumping. My feet tinkle and my skin is chiverying. We take the bus with out hopes high and our hopes in the most perfect place. 

The city electric train here is called, MAX. It arrives at 8:30 am the end of our stop in downtown PDX -- that is short for Portland. Arriving a half an hour early can be a nervous crashing situation. We, the participants, scounder the area around to be.
