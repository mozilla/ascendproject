I don't have enough time to blog! 

I did my project and accidentally deleted it.....had to rush through the 2nd time so next time will be better. Yay learning!

Take 2!

I was going to make my first better project since there are so many things I messed up while rushing through it....but I kind of like the idea of having it to compare later. It's a good way to jump in to making mistakes publicly.

So the first week of Ascend was challenging in every way. But mostly in the good ways. Meeting 20 new people has it's own challenges but after a week of working and growing together those anxieties have subsided. Everyone is starting from different levels and it has been very useful to turn to each other for help.
 
We are becoming acclimated to public speaking whether we would like to or not :) Lots of mini presentations. I have really appreciated that it has been in groups it makes it a little more bearable. We have been introduced to vim and git. I still feel pretty lost but with each pull request it is slowly seeping into my brain.

In general the class has been a perfect setting to learn! I don't think I've ever felt as comfortable asking questions in a group or being ok with not understanding right away as I do in our class. They have gone to great length in creating a fun safe learning place and I'm so excited to be a part of it!
