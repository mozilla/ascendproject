Hello internets! This a simple tutorial on how to do a thing in 7 easy steps (more or less)!

So there are 4 versions of Firefox (Beta, Nightly, Aurora, and Firefox). To run tests on all of them, you need all of them. Only you are not allowed to open more than 1 at a time-that is, unless you have more than 1 profile. So let’s get some more profiles!

First download all the [things](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/#beta). Three of the browsers are right here and you can side scroll though them! How handy! So download Beta and move it to applications (also re-name it Beta-it has the same icon regular Firefox so it will be useful in telling them apart).

Next I downloaded and installed Aurora and Firefox. Then go to [Nightly](https://nightly.mozilla.org/) for the last download and install that.

Now you have 4 browsers. But in order to open 2 or more at the same time you will need to make corresponding profiles. I don’t know if that is super clear so let’s just jump into things.

Make sure none of the Firefox browsers are open. Then open Terminal. Type in:

/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin -p


After you hit enter it will bring up a profile window like this:

Click the "Create a profile" to the left and make one named "aurora", "nightly", "beta", and then you can use your "default" profile for Firefox. Now when you open a browser it will ask you which profile you'd like to use.

It should look like this now!

Happy testing!
