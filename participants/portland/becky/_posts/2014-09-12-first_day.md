#First day of Ascend Project

The first day of the Ascend Project was full of awesome. We took some time getting comfortable and meeting each other, learning about each others strengths and how we can help each other. 

We also got to hang out with everyone during the Mozilla Monday Meeting. Which was kind of a cool experience. Watching people be okay with their mistakes and the mistakes of others. 

There is a lot of information which is overwhelming but offers *so* much. It will be an exciting adventure in a fun environment.
