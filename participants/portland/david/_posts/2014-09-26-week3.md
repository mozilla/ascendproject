###Recap so fresh. You all are scared to do what i do...

######amirite?

So boom, this week we set up Virtual Box, got me all excited just thinking back to it.
I really like the idea of running multiple OS on a single computer. It's really cool that you can do that.
We did this so we could observe ourselves write a patch and see the outcome on a different OS. It's a lot simpler to do than I thought.
Learning to create a patch was the last thing we needed to learn before we went off to fix bugs and become a self sustaining contributor to Mozilla and the open sauce community.
I decided to choose The bug my sister reported, [1066148](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1066148), which is super cool.

We also put a Wordpress site on the internet this week. [Mine](http://david.karveldigital.com) has yet to have anything on it, all i've done is choose a theme i thought looked cool. But there is a
crap load of stuff you have to do to put a website on the internet. I dont honestly know how Kronda can handle doing that for people. I guess when its your job you get used to it.
Over all things going great.
