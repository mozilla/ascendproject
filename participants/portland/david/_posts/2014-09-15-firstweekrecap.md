Man did we have a week, a lot of git hub stuff has been thrown around and it's been confusing for many people. I've been glad I could get help.
Personally it hasn't been to hard on me, I knew most of the github stuff that we've doing so i could actually help the others around me which has felt nice.
This last day we had a maker party where we would have to make a thing on https://Webmaker.org and well it didn't quite go to plan to be honest.

This is what I first made as I panicked

Well, its a thing... that's for sure.

But after I thought about it I began to think about what I taught my self when i was younger, I tried my hand a graphic design and i thought about making a resource for myself and others.

This is what I made before time was up.
