<- Ascend ~ Week One in Review ~ ->

~~Community Building~~

* Meet and build the Team.
* Find your individual strengths.
* Examine and discuss your strengths.
* Discuss some more and redefine those strengths and OWN them!
* Commit one of those babies to the group.
* Embrace each other.

Appreciate this community building and our collective agreements.  Can you find this is a typical tech company/environment?  One could not only hope...and build.

From day one to day five, anxiety transforms into excitement, confidence and it's infectious!
