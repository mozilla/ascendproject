The first day of the Ascend project was on September 8th, 2014. On the first day we went over ground for the space terms of working together as a group (how are we going to treat one another and what not) as well as the space at large (cleaning up after oneself, which spaces are for Mozilla staff as opposed to participants of the Ascend Project, etc). We also completed a skill finder assessment and did group activities around our results.

In short, when didn't do any code related things on the first day (though we did unbox our MacBook Airs), rather we worked on how to make sure our shared working environment is conducive for learning and working together.
