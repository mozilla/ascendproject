It's the end of the week and I'm actually really proud of the fact that I was able to get through it having gone from never had a 9 to 5 job to being in class in the Ascend Project from 9 to 5. We've gone from doing primarily "Who are we as learners, how do we want the space to look like, how do we treat eachother?" to "Navigate your way around the command line, customize the bash, here's how to get out of Vim."

Today we did a lot of stuff involving termnal in the morning. This afternoon we talked about web literacy topics such as privacy, security, searching, and open licensing. We also played around with Webmaker - my results of that are here: https://aokoye.makes.org/thimble/LTIwNTc3NjQ2MDg=/spinning-topics .
