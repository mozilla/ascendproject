## Best day of the rest of my life. 
It's difficult to trust what you don't understand. To embark on a journey with folks you just met, and believe that whatever happens will be better than all previous paths exhausted. How do you prepare for a new life chapter, a hard re-direct? 
By showing up and doing the work! Knowing that the road is paved, despite not being able to see more than one step ahead. Trusting that you were chosen for your aptitude, and that your mentors/teachers/guides have your best interest in mind. 
Believing that you are a part of something bigger than yourself. A movement of modern needs for equality. 
This is my chance to make a difference, a contribution on a scale I cannot currently comprehend. As I move forward, I will remember this opportunity as a major turning point and smile.
