## A week in wonder.
The night before the first day of the program was reminiscent of the joys I had prior to visiting Disneyland as a kid. I couldn't sleep in anticipation. I did not know what to expect, I did know that I was about to embark on a journey. My peers in the project would become my new community, my family. 
We are here to make a difference in the face of technology. We are here to change the future in the present. To become part of something larger than ourselves.
As the week progressed, I had a slew of negative affirmations- self delivered. Thoughts that reflected past experiences when attempting to break the glass ceiling and into a realm of possibilities. Fortunately, the facilitators/ mentors/ prophets of the program have been nothing short of a blessing. They have provided me with a wonderful learning environment that is conducive to the learning of all participants.
Amazed, blessed, grateful, are not sufficient in explaining the overwhelming positivity I feel towards this experience.
