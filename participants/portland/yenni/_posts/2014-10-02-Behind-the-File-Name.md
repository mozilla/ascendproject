There was a week of radio silence in my blogging due to what I like to call -pain brain- it's when my chronic pain becomes so unmanageable that my neurotransmitters decide to focus on causing me to be aware of pain instead of allowing me to think, learn, and generally be productive. Coming out of that state and back in the running of the Ascend pack has been no easy feat. There's So.Much.Learning!

This week we finally picked our bug. The crux of the project, and the reason for all the intense learning. My chosen bug had some big words in the description that enticed me to take it on. "Consolidate... into a single function for pluralization" Seems easy, right? Sexy even? In that community building sense, of course. I felt it call out to me and had to make it mine. Silly thing is, although the words caught my attention, I had no idea what that request meant. 

Where would I find the code? What would I do with it once I found it? What do any of those words mean arranged in that manner? 

No big deal. I would just take learning one day at a time.

The first step would be to find the code I would be inserting myself into and forever changing. I would have to become intimate with this code, understand its' inner workings, figure out what makes is flow freely.

In bugzilla, where the code was reported, the code was mentioned and I had to then search for it in my development environment on my personal computer. My life mentor and creator of the Ascend project, Lukas Blakk, was so kind as to help me find the location of where the code was found- setup.js -is my golden ticket. That's where my bug is housed and where I will make a name for myself, or at least be considered a member of the Open Source community once I submit a patch.

Talk about windows of opportunity! When I opened setup.js in my text editor -that's fancy way to say that I could not mess with the code instead of just oogling at it- I was amazed by how many lines of code it housed. Over 1000! There were so many functions I had never heard of, so many commands I didn't know could make a difference, so much magic.

I realized that a seemingly meaningless name such as setup.js could actually be the backbone of Firefox. That's my assumption anyway, haven't quite figured it out. Stay tuned, and you will learn as I do about all the magic behind the setup.js face.
