#One Week Up the Stairs: **Climbing Onward**
##September 12, 2014

The first week of Ascend has been a **flood** of information, and we're learning as we go, but there's a lot of catching up to do!

We're each *creatively multitasking* to make contributions while learning different aspects of programming.

What's great about the Ascend Project is that we're all taking in the energy of the space, solving problems as they arise, asking questions, and taking care of business, as individuals and as a team.  We are students.  We are teachers.  We are innovators.  We are cheerleaders.  We are friends.  As Mozillians, we can fulfill each of these roles, and more!  We can plan our goals, equip ourselves with the tools to succeed, and carry onward with the thoughtful support of our team.

It's been a long time since I've had such a jam-packed schedule as I do with Ascend.  I've become accustomed to independent projects, and my schedule has always been flexible.  Making the 9 to 5 schedule each day has made me feel a little more sleep-deprived, but every time I walk to the office, I feel a rush of inspiration about the new day.  In one short week I have learned so much, and each day brings new challenge with new hope. 

So far, I've learned how to use Vim, debugged the Evil Snowperson's photo theft, explored the command line prompts, researched various topics for presentations, explored Mozilla's latest innovations, solved problems with my classmates, contributed to the Etherpad, participated in several teaching moments, identified some bugs, and started designing an HTML page with Webmaker's Thimble!  Here's the draft of my page:
