Here we are. I can't believe it's been six weeks already. I can't believe the Ascend Project is over. It's been so worthwile. What a spectacular experience. I haven't ever considered myself a very lucky person, but I feel so unbelievably lucky to have gotten to do this.

I look at what I came into this knowing and what I know now and the difference is ridiculous. It was an intense crash course in puter stuff and I think I did a pretty good job. I wouldn't say I nailed it, because I still have much to learn code-wise, but I definitely did better than I expected. I still have a lot of work that I'm going to leave here with. But, I think I'm well enough equipped now to get it done on my own. 

I had a good and bad week. I think I was a little emotional underneath everything and it was manifesting in funny ways. I had some big time highs and lows, culminating in a very depressing day of laying in the bath feeling worthless. All in all, though, I got some stuff done, did a good presentation, worked on a few bugs &c. I don't have much to show for the work I did (no patches landed or anything) but at least I know more stuff. 

I'm really going to miss this awesome bunch of people. Everyone has their quirks and I feel like I'm just recently getting to know them rather well. I'm hoping to stay in touch. Amanda set a challenge of a bug a day until we get a job and I think that sounds pretty good. I'm going to try that. I'm going to miss the bus rides with Yenni and Virginia, and Yenni's favorite bus driver. I'm going to miss going to Los Gorditos with Lisa and Carmen. I'm going to miss David's jokes and Tina's brilliance and Eva's and Adam's banter (and knitting). And Bex's (Becky, that's you) sunnyness. And everybody! Who am I kidding? Y'all are great!!! Sorry Yenni, had to steal that one.

And as I"m writing this I'm eating some soup and regretting it. I don't need this soup. Why am I eating this? I guess that's one thing that'll do me good is to not be around so much awesome free vegan food all day every day. Wow, we've been spoiled. Catered lunches and a prepaid card for going out. I think I must've put on 10 lbs. I'm not too worried because I'm going to get it together starting Monday. Hit the gym, eat right, lawyer up, delete Facebook...am I doing this right?

Look, I already said I'm weird and emotional right now so that's why I'm blogging so incoherently, K? 

So yeah, here we are. I just gave my final presentation earlier today, so I guess that's it. There's still another day of presentations, but for my part, I'm done. This baby bird is gonna fly the nest soon. I'm scared, nervous, and sad, but more than that, I'm excited. I have so many more options now than I did before. So much more I can do with my life. So much more that I *want* to do. I feel pretty optimistic. 

"I think it's gonna be alright. Yeah, the worst is over now. The morning sun is shining like a red rubber ball."
