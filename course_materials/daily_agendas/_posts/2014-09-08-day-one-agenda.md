Agenda

9-9:30 am :  Breakfast

Morning:

* Checkin & Introductions
* Attendance Policy
* W9, transit passes, receipts collecting, etc
* Tour the office
* Unbox the laptops, nametags, created

LUNCH & Mozilla Community Meeting

Afternoon:

* Strength Finder quiz
* Exploring results
* Checkout

Notes:  We did get through all this, though we ended up moving the physical tour
to the end of the day.  The attendance policy discussion was very useful and resulted
in an adjusted policy that everyone could get behind and was more explicit.
