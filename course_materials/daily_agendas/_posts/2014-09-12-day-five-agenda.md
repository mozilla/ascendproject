Notes:  We didn't have nearly enough time to spend on blogging, and webmaker
respectively.  Should have sorted this week out a little more to have tighter
command line/git lessons and then not do any of that on this day.  Also the stipend
dispersal took another 30-40 minutes after being "done" for the day.
