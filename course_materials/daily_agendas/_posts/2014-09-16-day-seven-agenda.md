Notes:  We spent more time debriefing about the meeting, about:about moved to
after lunch.  Also inserted a presentation on the Rapid Release trains before the
MozTrap part because there were a lot of questions about why you'd use
one version of FF over another. Lots of first bugs (~6) filed on this day.
