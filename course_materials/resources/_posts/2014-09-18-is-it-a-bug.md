# Questions to ask yourself


## Can I reproduce it?

> 1. Every time?
> 1. Intermittently? If yes - how frequently?
> 1. With a clean profile* (same channel/build)?
> 1. With a clean profile* (different channels - most recent build)?

Being able to reproduce a bug only in certain channels (i.e.: in Nightly but not Aurora)
is useful for knowing where the _regression_ has occurred and allows developers to more
easily uncover the root cause.

'*' Clean profile: when you launch FF with the profile manager, create a 'throwaway' profile 
to test the bug with so you know you're starting with no addons, plugins, or other differences
from a new installation of Firefox.
